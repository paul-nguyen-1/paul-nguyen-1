I'm a Computer Science student at Oregon State University with a strong interest in web development, especially full stack with a focus on the front end. I love building clean, responsive interfaces and turning ideas into real, usable products. I'm always curious about new tools and frameworks and enjoy learning by doing. Creating things that are both functional and visually thoughtful is what drives me.
